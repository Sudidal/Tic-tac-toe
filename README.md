# Tic-tac-toe
made as a project for TOP


A BIT OF A MESS
like, I wanted to make this a type of organized project where I start by planning before diving in

and that what i've done but got the opposite

i started by doing a research about project planning on paper, what i have reached is that it's not an important thing, at least for me

so instead i tried to draw how the final product would appear, i only did that for the UI, and i think that helped because i didn't suffer from the UI (maybe because it's just simple for this project)

but i skiped the logic part because it can't be drawn (I think this is where i should have palnned things on paper)

I did not dive in so fast but i took a refresher of objects and factories and wrote the notes on my notebook
then i started diving

at first what i've got was a total mess, I immediatly found myself lost in a really small piece of code

the curriculum suggested to start making the app work only on console first to make sure the logic work fine even without the ui (this is what it means to separate the logic from the visuals)
but i thought i would prefer to make a simple ui and make the logic on it

and that's what i did.

then remembered the curriculum suggested to try to make the most use of objects in this project, i took a look at my code and realized i did not use objects even once

so i tried to implement objects and here where things got really bad

my knowled in c# was was in conflict with what i've learned in JS

I got frustrated so quickly that even after years of coding i still suffer with tiny simple projects like this, i even had to watch a tutorial (it's not a bad thing but im supposed to be faster than that)

I was working in a really bad environment, (The overthinking of the need to get better - remembering that im wasting a lot of time - worrying about the useless school and the exam tomorrow - having to go to gym after that - ramadan)

all of that should be worked with in one day

and I still didn't find a way out of that ugly circle

i'm only writing this because i believe i will get better
even years after im sure i will re-read this and i will remember how bad i felt that day, the feeling that i was just wasting my time with no real progress

the only problem i'm currently getting is my DAY

oh and with all of that i even fogot to commit to git :/

EDIT: this time, i will learn from this project
what where the problems i faced, what caused them, how could i work with them????
This time in-sha'a allah i won't waste my work, this is what learning is all about, making mistakes, then learn from them
